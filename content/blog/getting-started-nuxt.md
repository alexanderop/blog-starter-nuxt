# Getting Started with Nuxt 3

Nuxt 3 is a powerful framework for building **Vue.js applications** with many built-in features that make development a breeze.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Auto-imports
No more manual imports! Nuxt automatically imports:
- Vue composables (`ref`, `reactive`, `computed`)
- Nuxt composables (`useFetch`, `useRouter`, etc.)
- Your own composables from `~/composables/`

### 📁 File-based Routing
Create pages simply by adding `.vue` files to the `pages/` directory:

```
pages/
  index.vue          → /
  about.vue          → /about
  blog/
    index.vue        → /blog
    [slug].vue       → /blog/:slug
```

### ⚡ Server-Side Rendering
Get the best of both worlds with:
- **SSR** for better SEO and initial load times
- **SPA** navigation for smooth user experience
- **Static generation** for maximum performance

## Installation

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init my-nuxt-app
cd my-nuxt-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
