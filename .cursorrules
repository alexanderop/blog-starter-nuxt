# Cursor Rules

## Code Quality Guidelines

### Comments
- Do not add comments that are not needed
- Only add comments when the code purpose is not self-evident
- Avoid redundant comments that just restate what the code does
- Focus on writing self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Add comments only to explain "why" not "what" when the logic is complex

### General Principles
- Prefer clear, readable code over verbose comments
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Keep code concise and focused
- Remove commented-out code rather than leaving it in place
